## About the Collection

Background of the railroad suspension bridge

The Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge was the world's first operating railroad suspension bridge, standing across the Niagara River from 1855 to 1897. It stretches 825 feet (251 metres) and connects Niagara Falls, Ontario, to Niagara Falls, New York, 2.5 miles (4.0 kilometres) downstream. The bridge is part of Canadian politician William Hamilton Merritt's plan to increase domestic and international trade.

The Niagara Suspension Bridge connects Canada with the United States and has played a significant part in the history of both the Niagara area and the two countries. This bridge is crossed by three rail lines that connect cities on both sides of the border.
The name was changed to Whirlpool Rapids Bridge on August 27, 1897, after it was replaced by a stronger steel and iron version in 1886.

Terrapin Tower

General Parkhurst Whitney erected Terrapin Tower in 1829 as a circular tower 12m high and 3.7m in diameter out of rough stone obtained locally. A winding staircase rises to the top of this tower, where a smaller entrance opens to an external circular balcony secured by hefty metal railings. Guests may enjoy unrivalled views of the falls and the boiling gorge below from this balcony. Terrapin Tower was purposefully demolished in 1872 to prevent rivalry with the new Prospect Park tower. Those plans for a new tower never came to fruition, and no replacement tower was erected.
The timber walkway remained in existence for many years after Terrapin Tower was destroyed. It was in place until 1905.

Luna Island

Originally known as Prospect Island, it was renamed Luna Island when legendary lunar rainbows were observed over it on clear moonlight evenings in the 1800s. Unfortunately, due to the Falls' nightly illumination, moon rainbows are rarely observed today.
Luna Island is about 3/4 of an acre in size and is mostly made up of a thick covering of dolostone rock. Luna Island was formerly covered in white cedar trees.
Luna Island was closed to the public in 1954. This was due to the fact that the bedrock beneath the island had grown unstable, and there was concern that rock might fall off the island. Luna Island was off-limits to the public until 1972. The de-watering of the American Falls in 1969 enabled anti-erosion operations, including the removal of loose rock, which helped to stabilise the island.

Goat Island

Goat Island was called by John Stedman in the 1770s when he utilised the island to grow a herd of goats. All but one of the goats died during the bitterly cold winter of 1780. In 1795, John Stedman departed Niagara. Stedman gave his property to a friend, and in 1801 Stedman transferred ownership to the State of New York, including Goat Island.
Goat Island was renamed Iris Island by General Augustus Porter, a United States Commissioner, after the Greek Goddess of the Rainbow. Because people objected to the name change, the island was renamed Goat Island. Goat Island had seen minimal development by 1806. Bears and wolves were typical sightings, as was a plethora of deer. Augustus Porter purchased Goat Island from the State of New York in 1816. He constructed a wooden bridge from the mainland to the upper end of the island in 1817. The next winter, ice damaged this bridge. So, in 1818, Porter constructed another bridge to Goat Island, this time closer to the Falls. This bridge was rebuilt by an iron bridge in 1856. The State of New York established the New York State Niagara Reservation Park on July 15, 1885. Locals referred to Deer Island as the largest and closest island to the Goat Island beach.

Tightrope Walkers

Since the 1800s, daredevils have walked over the Niagara canyon on a tightrope. Its apparent dangers keep viewers interested, and funambulists have utilised a variety of gimmicks to cross the wires, including stilts, bicycles, and walking backwards.

Three Sisters Islands (New York)

The islands are named after General Parkhurst Whitney's daughters, Celinda, Angelina, and Asenath Whitney (all three are buried at Oakwood Cemetery in Niagara Falls, New York). General Whitney (who is also buried at Oakwood Cemetery) was a famous early pioneer in Niagara Falls, New York. In 1810, the General relocated to Niagara Falls, New York, and is most known as the creator and operator of the Cataract House Hotel, which is located near the falls above the rapids. The first people to walk to the three islands are thought to have been General Whitney's daughters.

Visual Culture of Niagara in the 19th Century.

Niagara is famous for its breathtaking scenery. In the 19th century, the growth of the tourism industry brought about a steady development of the building infrastructure. Many bridges like the Three Sisters Bridge have been built between the various islands. It allows visitors to touch nature. The falls have also been transformed from a dangerous wilderness to a comfortable tourist attraction. People can enjoy the magnificent view of the waterfall during the day. You can also take pictures of the colorful falls light show at night. Especially from the 1860s onwards, as the region embraced technological and commercial interventions. Niagara region, a number of natural parks and reserves were established to protect the land around the falls. At the same time, engineers and investors built several hydroelectric power plants near the reserve and developed more industries in the vicinity. Both developments have attracted more travelers to the area. to witness the wonders of the region's new landscapes and new technologies. This in turn inspired new forms of travel writing, celebrating the natural grandeur of the waterfall's restoration and its new industrial sublimity.

In the visual art of 19th century Niagara, the falls certainly carry a stunning visual effect. The main feature of the waterfall is the magnificent landscape, both provided by nature and by the technical and tourist infrastructure that exploits it.

George E. Curtis' photographs are characterized by a combination of nature and industrialization. His photographs document the coexistence of natural and human-engineered wonders for which Niagara is famous in the 19th century. But at the same time, the natural beauty of the Niagara region is diminishing because of industrialization. George E. Curtis documents the changes in Niagara with tourism and industrialization by photographing some of the buildings and events of the time. It also wants to express the ever-changing and competing concepts of nature.
